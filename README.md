# Data Engineering Lab

This repository serves as a central hub for my data engineering studies and hands-on practice.

Here, you will find links to multiple sub-repositories, each focused on specific topics and projects aimed at improving my skills as a Data Engineer and Software Engineer.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Practice real-world data engineering concepts
- Build a consistent and well-documented portfolio
- Experiment with tools, libraries, and architectures used in production environments
- Strengthen both data and software engineering fundamentals

## Topics Covered

The projects in this repository and its sub-repositories may include:

- Data Engineering fundamentals
- ETL and ELT pipelines
- Data ingestion and transformation
- SQL and data modeling
- Pandas and data analysis
- Data structures and algorithms
- Batch and streaming processing
- Data quality and validation
- Backend concepts applied to data systems

## Repository Structure

Each folder or linked repository focuses on a specific subject or project, for example:

- `etl-pipelines/`
- `pandas-practice/`
- `sql-and-data-modeling/`
- `data-structures/`
- `mini-projects/`

Every project contains its own README with explanations, design decisions, and instructions to run the code.

## Technologies

Depending on the project, the following technologies may be used:

- Python
- Pandas
- SQL
- Git & GitHub
- Linux
- Docker (when applicable)
- Other data-related tools and frameworks

## Notes

This repository is continuously evolving as I learn new concepts and improve existing implementations. Refactoring and documentation updates are part of the process.
